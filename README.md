👋 Hi, I’m @ahanacodes

👀 I’m interested in leveraging technology and data analytics to solve complex problems in the fields of last mile delivery and non-profit food rescue operations. I believe in the power of big data to make informed decisions and create impactful solutions.

🌱 I’m currently pursuing my PhD in Management Science at McMaster University, where I'm deepening my understanding of quantitative methods, optimization, and supply chain management to address challenges in logistics and operations.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to improve the efficiency of logistics networks, enhance the effectiveness of non-profit food distribution, and any innovative use of big data that can have a social impact. I'm particularly passionate about projects that strive for sustainable and equitable solutions in the logistics and food sectors.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at iahanamalhotraa@gmail.com for collaborations, discussions, or if you just want to chat about the potential of data science and operations research in creating a better world.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not crunching numbers or navigating through datasets, I love exploring the outdoors and finding new hiking trails. It's my way of connecting with nature and recharging my creativity for my research work.
